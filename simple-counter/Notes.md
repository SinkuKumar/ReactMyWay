- I'm modifying only the `src/App.js` code and want to change the code minimum to make the app possible.
- I remember the concept of `useState` and I'm going to try with this approach. It worked.
- Later, I'm thinking to learn about different ways how to make a simple counter and implement it.
- Test cases are generated with the help of AI. Get explanation about [writing tests](./WritingTests.md).
- Find [different ways](./DifferentWays.md) to create simple counter.
