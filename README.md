# ReactMyWay
Learning React in my way.

## Introduction

Learning React can be approached in several ways, but I want to share my unique method, which combines trial and error, official documentation, Stack Overflow, blogs, posts, articles, and my own insights, with extensive use of AI. My strategy is to learn by doing projects.

I'll be working on projects from zero to hero, with suggestions from ChatGPT and some of my own ideas, all detailed in the [1_Project.md](1_Project.md) file.

Let's dive in and start creating!

## Getting Started

Since I already have some experience with React, I'll be taking a bird's-eye view and starting with a high-level overview of React, as detailed in the [0_GettingStarted.md](0_GettingStarted.md) file.

## Projects
