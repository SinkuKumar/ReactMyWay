Let's break down the line of code:

```javascript
const [tasks, setTasks] = useState([]);
```

Here's what each part of this line does:

1. **`const`**:
   - This keyword declares a constant variable in JavaScript. In this context, it means that the variable `tasks` and the function `setTasks` cannot be reassigned to a different value or function. However, the contents of the `tasks` array can be modified.

2. **`[tasks, setTasks]`**:
   - This is array destructuring. The `useState` hook returns an array with exactly two elements:
     1. The current state value (`tasks`).
     2. A function to update the state (`setTasks`).
   - By using array destructuring, we assign the first element of the array to the `tasks` variable and the second element to the `setTasks` function.

3. **`useState([])`**:
   - `useState` is a hook provided by React for managing state in functional components.
   - It takes an initial state value as an argument. In this case, the initial state is an empty array (`[]`).
   - It returns an array with two elements:
     1. The current state (`tasks`), which initially is set to the empty array (`[]`).
     2. A function (`setTasks`) that allows you to update the state.

Putting it all together:
- The line declares a state variable `tasks` and a state updater function `setTasks`.
- `tasks` is initially an empty array.
- You can use `setTasks` to update the `tasks` state whenever necessary in your component.

For example, if you want to add a new task, you can call `setTasks` with a new array containing the new task along with the existing ones.

Let's break down this function:

```javascript
const addTask = (task) => {
    setTasks([...tasks, { id: Date.now(), text: task, completed: false }]);
};
```

1. **`const addTask = (task) => { ... };`**:
   - This line declares a constant `addTask` and assigns it an arrow function.
   - The function takes one parameter, `task`, which is expected to be the text or description of the new task.

2. **`setTasks([...tasks, { id: Date.now(), text: task, completed: false }]);`**:
   - This line calls the `setTasks` function to update the `tasks` state.

Here's the detailed breakdown of the state update:

- **`setTasks([...tasks, ...])`**:
  - The spread operator (`...tasks`) is used to create a new array that includes all the current tasks. This ensures that the state update is done immutably, meaning it doesn't directly modify the existing `tasks` array but creates a new one with the existing tasks and the new task.

- **`{ id: Date.now(), text: task, completed: false }`**:
  - This is the new task object being added to the `tasks` array.
  - **`id: Date.now()`**:
    - The `id` property is assigned a unique identifier using `Date.now()`, which returns the current timestamp in milliseconds since January 1, 1970. This ensures each task has a unique `id`.
  - **`text: task`**:
    - The `text` property is assigned the value of the `task` parameter passed to the `addTask` function. This is the description or text of the new task.
  - **`completed: false`**:
    - The `completed` property is initially set to `false`, indicating that the new task has not been completed yet.

Putting it all together:
- When `addTask` is called with a task description, it creates a new task object with a unique `id`, the provided `text`, and a `completed` status of `false`.
- It then updates the state by creating a new array that includes all the current tasks and the new task, ensuring the state update is done immutably.

This function is useful for adding new tasks to a to-do list or similar task management application.


Let's break down this function:

```javascript
const deleteTask = (taskId) => {
    setTasks(tasks.filter(task => task.id !== taskId));
};
```

1. **`const deleteTask = (taskId) => { ... };`**:
   - This line declares a constant `deleteTask` and assigns it an arrow function.
   - The function takes one parameter, `taskId`, which is expected to be the unique identifier (`id`) of the task that needs to be deleted.

2. **`setTasks(tasks.filter(task => task.id !== taskId));`**:
   - This line calls the `setTasks` function to update the `tasks` state.

Here's the detailed breakdown of the state update:

- **`tasks.filter(task => task.id !== taskId)`**:
  - The `filter` method creates a new array containing all tasks that do not match the `taskId` passed to the `deleteTask` function.
  - **`task => task.id !== taskId`**:
    - This is a callback function used by the `filter` method. It checks each task in the `tasks` array.
    - If the `id` of a task is not equal to the `taskId`, the task is included in the new array.
    - If the `id` of a task is equal to the `taskId`, the task is excluded from the new array.

Putting it all together:
- When `deleteTask` is called with a `taskId`, it filters out the task with that `id` from the `tasks` array.
- It then updates the state by creating a new array that includes only the tasks that do not match the `taskId`, ensuring the state update is done immutably.

This function is useful for removing tasks from a to-do list or similar task management application.

Let's break down this function:

```javascript
const toggleTaskCompletion = (taskId) => {
    setTasks(tasks.map(task => 
      task.id === taskId ? { ...task, completed: !task.completed } : task
    ));
};
```

1. **`const toggleTaskCompletion = (taskId) => { ... };`**:
   - This line declares a constant `toggleTaskCompletion` and assigns it an arrow function.
   - The function takes one parameter, `taskId`, which is expected to be the unique identifier (`id`) of the task whose completion status needs to be toggled.

2. **`setTasks(tasks.map(task => ...));`**:
   - This line calls the `setTasks` function to update the `tasks` state.

Here's the detailed breakdown of the state update:

- **`tasks.map(task => ...)`**:
  - The `map` method creates a new array with the results of calling a provided function on every element in the `tasks` array.
  - **`task => task.id === taskId ? { ...task, completed: !task.completed } : task`**:
    - This is a callback function used by the `map` method. It checks each task in the `tasks` array.
    - **`task.id === taskId`**:
      - If the `id` of a task is equal to the `taskId`, the task is the one we want to toggle.
      - **`{ ...task, completed: !task.completed }`**:
        - This creates a new task object by copying all properties of the existing task (`{ ...task }`).
        - It then overrides the `completed` property with the negated value (`!task.completed`). This toggles the `completed` status of the task.
    - **`: task`**:
      - If the `id` of a task is not equal to the `taskId`, the task remains unchanged.

Putting it all together:
- When `toggleTaskCompletion` is called with a `taskId`, it maps over the `tasks` array.
- For the task with the matching `id`, it creates a new task object with the `completed` status toggled.
- For all other tasks, it leaves them unchanged.
- It then updates the state by creating a new array with the updated task list, ensuring the state update is done immutably.

This function is useful for toggling the completion status of tasks in a to-do list or similar task management application.
